use python to simulate basic language

REM <comment>: use to write comment
Let <expression> = <expression>: use to assign value to variable
RUN: use to execute the stored code list
input <expression>: use to accept user input into variable
print <expression>: use to print value to screen
cls: use to clear to screen
goto <expression>: use to jump to execution to another sentence
if <expression> then <command> else <command>: conditional statement
end: halt the execution of "run"
exit: exit the tiny basic interpreter
list: print the stored code list to the screen
clear: clear the code list
gosub / return: "gosub" is used to invoke a subroutine at a specified line number, "return" is used to go back to the position of "gosub" to continue running
gotoxy (row, column): use to make display at certain position
extend operators: (<<, >>)left shifting and right shifting calculation
save <filename.tb>: use to save the stored code list to a file
load <filename.tb>: use to load a file to the stored code list
for <variable> = <number> to <number> (step <number>) do <command> / for <variable> = <number> to <number> (step <number>) ... next <variable>:
  for loop(in one sentence and muitiple sentence version)
stop: use to stop the executionof a tiny basic program and pass control to the tiny basic monitor
math function: sin(), asin(), cos(), acos(), tan(), atan(), sinh(), asinh(), cosh(), acosh(), tanh(), atanh(), log1p(), log2(), log10(), sqrt(), exp(), degrees(), radians()
